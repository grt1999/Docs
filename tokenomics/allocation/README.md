# ðŸ“Ž Allocation

A portion of the token supply, representing 10%, will be made available for sale in a private allocation round. Another portion, representing 25%, will be offered in public allocation rounds. Additionally, 5% of the supply will be allocated to establish the initial liquidity upon launch.

Furthermore, 20% of the token supply will be reserved for the team, while another 5% will be dedicated to supporting marketing initiatives and research and development (R\&D) endeavors. The remainder will be apportioned in the following manner:

* 10% strategic advisors/angels and early contributors
* 10% seed round
* 5% allocated for platform development
* 5% community allocation

To ensure the protocol's long-term sustainability and expansion, 5% of the supply will be allocated to the Insurance fund reserve at the time of launch.&#x20;
