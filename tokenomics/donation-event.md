# ðŸ“… Donation Event

**How it works:** By utilizing $ETH, $WBTC, $USDC and/or $USDT, contributors can donate tokens during a \[90-day] period, when the Community Donation Pool is active.

During the donation campaign period, contributors can conduct an evaluation to assess whether the project aligns with their values and goals. If the evaluation is favorable, the participant will be able to support the project by contributing supported tokens to the Donation Pool Fund. Control over the tokens in the Donation Pool Fund is maintained by 7VFI.AI smart contracts.

By participating in the community donation pool, contributors gain access to automated strategies, receiving utility tokens that grant access to the platform resources at a discount on the launch price. The distribution of utility $7VFI tokens is carried out on a pro rata basis, where the amount received is directly proportional to the contribution made.
