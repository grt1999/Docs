# ðŸ“ª Token Details

In essence, 7VFI is primarily designed as an access token, ensuring users can fully engage with our ecosystem. Our goal is to ensure a stable TVL growth and achieve a gradual increase in token price.

To facilitate this, a burning mechanism will be activated each time a user accesses the platform. Additionally, the protocol and DAO will be supplied with necessary funds through periodic minting. This approach aims to sustain platform operations while maintaining an optimal token supply level.

Our approach entails monthly token minting alongside daily token burning. This consistent monthly minting strategy ensures that our users always have an ample supply of tokens to access our platform's modules. By striking this balance, we aim to create a sustainable ecosystem where accessibility to our modules remains uninterrupted.

**Long-term Deflationary Token:**

* Based on growth and performance.
* Monthly token minting combined with daily token burning.
* Buyback & burn mechanisms: 5% of strategy profit performance fees will be used for token buyback and burn.
* 1% of the profit generated from strategy fees will be donated to institutions and NGOs, aiming to support the education and professional development of young individuals who aspire to pursue a career in the technology sector but face barriers to access.
