# ðŸ’² Staking Module

The platform fees collected on 7VFI token transactions and "portfolio management activities" will primarily benefit 7VFI token holders. In addition to performance fees, these holders will enjoy a share of the platform's fee revenue.

**Staking:** Lock-up periods of 6, 12, 18 or 24 months. Rewards paid in USDC.

* Strategy profits will be converted to USDC or ETH and distributed pro-rata to staked 7VFI token holders
* APY variable stake with minimum distribution
* 25% of fees generated from token swap will be used to pay stakers and lock liquidity
* Emergency Withdraw: The early withdrawal during the 24-month lock-up period will be subject to a 70% tax, which will gradually decrease to a 50% tax for the 6-month stake period.
