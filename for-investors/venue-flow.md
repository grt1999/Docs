# ðŸ”Ž Venue Flow

We will leverage account abstraction and tap into the potential of both established and emerging liquid staking platforms. Our approach aims to simplify the search for venues and integrations with liquid staking derivative tokens across diverse DeFi protocols. With a visual and comprehensive strategy, we facilitate seamless integration and exploration of liquid staking and LSD-fi projects.

Our methodology aims to accommodate users' risk profiles, providing them with the flexibility to select from various risk categories and protocols presented for LSD venues. Based on their risk orientation, users can choose between low-risk, mid-risk, or risk-oriented options. This approach empowers users to make informed decisions that align with their risk preferences.
