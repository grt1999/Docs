## Navigating Complex DeFi Processes: Empowering Users for Optimal Yield Generation

<mark style="color:red;">The concept of "money-legos" in DeFi refers to the ability to combine different protocols to create complex financial structures. EXPLAIN FI NSIMPLE TERMS Just like building with interlocking building blocks, where each block represents a specific DeFi protocol or application. By combining these "money-legos," users can create innovative strategies for generating continuous yield in the DeFi ecosystem. However, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration of the risks involved. Users face risks when selecting subpar protocols or mistiming their investments and capital delegation on farming and staking opportunities. Our goal is to streamline this journey, enabling "yield hopping" by leveraging the compound interest effect.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">We achieve this by recycling profits from our core positions to "satellite positions" in niche market segments. These niche market segments host protocols that serve as yield aggregators and yield optimizers, transparent and reliable projects, be they established or emerging</mark>. Our approach also involves capitalizing on sustainable revenue sources across various categories and embracing the potential of liquid staking derivative tokens, thereby generating extra yield.

By doing so, we consolidate our positions, enhance our earnings, and ultimately offer users the opportunity to achieve above-average returns. ADD IMAGE
