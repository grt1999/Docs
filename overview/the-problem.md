# ðŸ’¡ The Problem

1. **Complexity in Liquidity Management**

The intricacies of managing a position as a liquidity provider, coupled with the need for constant position monitoring and the complexities of readjusting the position when it strays from the desired range, as well as the inherent risks of impermanent loss, make concentrated liquidity provision a game reserved for experienced players who have developed sophisticated monitoring tools. Concentrated liquidity provision management It is not a game suited for the average user seeking simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to solve the challenges of usability via A.I. bots and tools and democratize these tools making them accessible to everyone. By leveraging A.I. and Machine Learning technologies, we aim to empower users of all levels of expertise to participate in concentrated liquidity provision and reap the benefits of this DeFi strategy.

2. **Difficulty in choosing reliable protocols**

Choosing reliable and secure protocols is of utmost importance in the crypto space, especially with the rising number of rug pulls and scams. Conducting a detailed code review, assessing smart contract risks, and prioritizing long-term security over short-term gains are essential steps to mitigate these risks. Some factors, such as the ones mentioned below, are crucial for evaluating protocols:

* Revenue Generation Model
* Longevity and Risk-Adjusted Growth
* Tokenomics
* User Adoption and Community Engagement
* Revenue Distribution Mechanisms
* Team

However, performing such due diligence is often challenging for users. Analyzing codes and assessing the trustworthiness of projects require technical expertise and deep understanding of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the constant evolution and complexity of the crypto landscape makes it even more difficult for individuals without specialized knowledge to navigate, identify and select trustworthy protocols.

3. **Shady practices and the obscurity of Liquid Staking Tokens**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-overcome-stench-shitcoins-ponzinomics-030400207.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-overcome-stench-shitcoins-ponzinomics-030400207.html</a></p></figcaption></figure>

The DeFi landscape faces a significant challenge with the proliferation of Ponzi-like schemes and unsustainable token distributions. These Ponzi-esque schemes present a major problem for the ecosystem. They not only undermine the integrity of the industry but also pose significant risks for users. The excessive reliance on token emissions and manipulative strategies leads to an unsustainable cycle, where the value of these tokens rapidly depreciates once the unsustainable practices comes to light.&#x20;

One of the biggest challenges for users today is finding practical applications for their LSD (Liquid Staking Derivative) tokens. Many are unaware of their tokens' various use cases, like using them as collateral in top borrowing/lending protocols or restaking them in another project, offering users new opportunities to make the most of their assets.
