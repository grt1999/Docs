The intricacies of managing a position as a liquidity provider, coupled with the need for constant position monitoring and the complexities of readjusting when it strays from the desired range, as well as the inherent risks of impermanent loss, EXPLAIN IL make **concentrated liquidity provision** a game reserved for experienced players who have developed sophisticated automation and monitoring tools. It is not a game suited for the average user seeking simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to democratize these tools and make them accessible to everyone. By leveraging AI and Machine Learning technologies, we aim to empower users of all levels of expertise to participate in concentrated liquidity provision and reap the benefits of this lucrative strategy.

Choosing reliable and secure protocols is of utmost importance in the crypto space, especially with the rising number of rug pulls and scams. Conducting a detailed code review, assessing smart contract risks, and prioritizing long-term security over short-term gains are essential steps to mitigate these risks. <mark style="color:red;">Some factors, such as the ones mentioned below, are crucial for evaluating protocols and their leadership:</mark>

* <mark style="color:red;">Revenue Generation Model</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Longevity and Risk-Adjusted Growth</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Tokenomics</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">User Adoption and Community</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Revenue Distribution Mechanisms</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Team</mark>

However, performing such due diligence is often challenging for the average user. Analyzing codes and assessing the trustworthiness of projects require technical expertise and deep understanding of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the constant evolution and complexity of the crypto landscape makes it even more difficult for individuals without specialized knowledge to navigate and identify trustworthy protocols.

The DeFi landscape faces a significant challenge with the proliferation of Ponzi-like schemes and unsustainable token distributions. These Ponzi-esque schemes present a major problem for the ecosystem. They not only undermine the integrity of the industry but also pose significant risks for users. The excessive reliance on token emissions and manipulative strategies leads to an unsustainable cycle, where the value of these tokens rapidly depreciates once the unsustainable practices comes to light.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Primary concerns:</mark>

* <mark style="color:red;">Proliferation of Ponzi-like schemes and unsustainable token distributions</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Undermining industry integrity</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Excessive reliance on token emissions and manipulative strategies</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Rapid depreciation of token value through inflationary token emissions</mark>

Moreover, such schemes divert attention and capital away from legitimate projects that focus on providing tangible value and sustainable revenue streams. It creates an environment where short-term gains overshadow long-term growth and innovation, hindering the overall development and adoption of DeFi.

Addressing this issue is crucial for the long-term success and credibility of the DeFi space.
