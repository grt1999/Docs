Holders of the 7visions NFT are entitled to receive a variable reward in USDC, which is determined by their ownership percentage of the NFT pool.

* x%, of the NFT minting cost is allocated to the NFT rewards pool.&#x20;
* Within this pool, x% is distributed every 24 hours based on the holder's ownership percentage in the NFT pool.&#x20;
* The remaining balance of the NFT minting cost is directed to the Reserve pool of the protocol Treasury.&#x20;
* Whenever 7VFI tokens are bought or sold, a percentage of the fees, specifically x%, is allocated to the NFT rewards pool.

**Benefits and Utility:**

1. Protocol Sustainability: By minting a 7Visions NFT using USDC, you contribute to strengthening the UnParallel's treasury and rewards pool, which in turn supports sustainability and longevity. The USDC allocated during the minting process is directed towards both the rewards pool and the protocol's treasury reserve.
2. ?- VIP access: Holding a Level 1 NFT grants you exclusive access to **Insights**, our proprietary scorecard analyzer designed for protocol assessment and selection which provides valuable insights and analysis, empowering investors to make informed decisions when evaluating various protocols within the DeFi space.
3. Ecosystem Rewards: Holders are entitled to a percentage of the ecosystem fees, directly linked to their position in the 7Visions NFT tier.
4. DAO: Holding a NFT grants entry to our DAO, a governance entity responsible for ecosystem decision-making. NFT holders gain voting rights to influence protocol changes, propose new projects, and other investment opportunities.
