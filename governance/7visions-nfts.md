**Benefits and Utility:**

1. Protocol Sustainability: By minting a 7Visions NFT using USDC, you contribute to strengthening the 7VFI's treasury, which in turn supports sustainability and longevity. The USDC allocated during the minting process is directed towards the protocol's treasury reserve.
2. DAO: Holding a NFT grants entry to our DAO, a governance entity responsible for ecosystem decision-making. NFT holders gain voting rights to influence protocol changes, propose new projects, and other investment opportunities.
