**Benefits and Utility:**

1. Protocol Sustainability: By minting a 7Visions NFT using USDC, you contribute to strengthening the 7VFI's treasury and rewards pool, which in turn supports sustainability and longevity. The USDC allocated during the minting process is directed towards both the rewards pool and the protocol's treasury reserve.
2. Ecosystem Rewards: Holders are entitled to a percentage of the ecosystem fees.
3. DAO: Holding a NFT grants entry to our DAO, a governance entity responsible for ecosystem decision-making. NFT holders gain voting rights to influence protocol changes, propose new projects, and other investment opportunities.
