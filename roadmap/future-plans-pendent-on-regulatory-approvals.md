Strategy fees will be converted to Blue-chip tokens/Stablecoins and distributed pro-rata to staked 7VFI token holders.

APY variable stake with minimum distribution 25% of fees generated from token swap will be used to pay stakers and lock liquidity.

Emergency Withdraw: The early withdrawal during the 24-month lock-up period will be subject to a 70% tax, which will gradually decrease to a 50% tax for the 6-month stake period.
