# Real Yield DeFi Protocols Analyzer - Rank Select

Real Yield refers to the yield generated from "real" revenue sources, such as transaction fees or user activity, rather than relying on token emissions or artificial incentives. Unlike receiving highly speculative tokens, users are typically paid in blue-chip tokens like ETH or stablecoins, providing a more stable and reliable income stream. Additionally, these protocols usually incorporate a fair and transparent fee distribution mechanism, where the fees collected on the platform are distributed to token holders and users, ensuring that they directly benefit from the protocol's success. Our scoring system acknowledges that protocols offering inflated APRs (Annual percentage rate) through token emissions may attract liquidity in the short term, but sustainable revenue generation is crucial for long-term success.

The 7VFI.AI Rank Select aims to be a robust tool that employs a multi-layered approach to assess and identify prolific opportunities across a range of DeFi protocols. 7VFI.AI Rank Select utilizes advanced analysis techniques and evaluates projects based on factors such as APR (Annual percentage rate), APY (Annual percentage yield), TVL (Total Value Locked), liquidity features, yield distribution mechanisms, and potential risks all in combination with community rating scores. Through this comprehensive evaluation process, various metrics go through multiple layers before receiving the final filter anchored in our scorecard. This ensures that only the most reliable and promising projects are highlighted for consideration.

The 7VFI.AI Rank Select scoring formula considers various factors, including:

* Revenue Generation Model&#x20;
* Longevity and Risk-Adjusted Growth
* Tokenomics
* User Adoption and Community Engagement
* Revenue Distribution Mechanisms&#x20;
* Community Rating Scores

By utilizing this tool, users can make informed decisions and optimize their strategies. To determine the best protocols, the 7VFI.AI Rank Select analyzer utilizes a robust proprietary scoring system that takes into account the concept of Real Yield. After ranking the selected protocols, users will have the option, through a "Zap-in" button, to select optimal weights across distinct protocols they wish to engage with. This feature empowers users to customize their portfolio and allocate funds according to their preferences and risk appetite, providing flexibility and control over their decisions.

By applying this scoring system, our 7VFI.AI Rank Select tool identifies and highlights the protocols that have strong fundamentals, sustainable revenue models, and the potential for long-term success in the Real Yield DeFi space. This comprehensive A.I. powered tool not only provides valuable insights but also facilitates research, analysis, discernment, and decision-making for users regarding the best market opportunities. With the 7VFI.AI Rank Select analyzer, users can navigate the complex DeFi landscape with ease, identifying the protocols that align with their goals while increasing their chances of success.

The 7VFI.AI Rank Select provides valuable insights through analyzing protocols, and simplifying the process of selecting sustainable Real Yield DeFi protocols. By evaluating crucial factors like transparency, security, and revenue streams, this A.I. tool empower users, from blockchain novices to experienced users, to navigate the complex landscape with ease. The 7VFI.AI Rank Select goal is to simplify the "Do Your Own Research" (DYOR) process for users of all levels of expertise in the DeFi space.
