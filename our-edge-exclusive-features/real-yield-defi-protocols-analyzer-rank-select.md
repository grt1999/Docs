# Real Yield DeFi Protocols Analyzer - Rank Select

Real Yield refers to the yield generated from "real" revenue sources, such as transaction fees or user activity, rather than relying on token emissions or artificial incentives. Unlike receiving highly speculative tokens, users are typically paid in blue-chip tokens like ETH or stablecoins, providing a more stable and reliable income stream. Additionally, these protocols usually incorporate a fair and transparent fee distribution mechanism, where the fees collected on the platform are distributed to token holders, users, and investors, ensuring that they directly benefit from the protocol's success. Our scoring system acknowledges that protocols offering inflated APRs (Annual percentage rate) through token emissions may attract liquidity in the short term, but sustainable revenue generation is crucial for long-term success.

Our Analyzer is a robust tool that employs a multi-layered approach to assess and identify profitable investment opportunities across a range of DeFi protocols. It utilizes advanced analysis techniques and evaluates projects based on factors such as APR (Annual percentage rate), APY(Annual percentage yield), TVL (Total Value Locked), liquidity features, yield distribution mechanisms, and potential risks. Through this comprehensive evaluation process, various metrics go through multiple layers before receiving the final filter anchored in our scorecard. This ensures that only the most reliable and promising projects are highlighted for consideration.

Our scoring formula considers various factors, including:

* Revenue Generation Model&#x20;
* Longevity and Risk-Adjusted Growth
* Tokenomics
* User Adoption and Community
* Revenue Distribution Mechanisms&#x20;

By utilizing this tool, we can make informed decisions and optimize our strategies. To determine the best protocols, our Analyzer utilizes a robust proprietary scoring system that takes into account the concept of Real Yield. After ranking the selected protocols, investors will have the option, through a "Zap-in" button, to select optimal weights across distinct protocols they wish to invest in. This feature empowers investors to customize their portfolio and allocate funds according to their preferences and risk appetite, providing flexibility and control over their investment decisions.&#x20;

By applying this scoring system, our **Analyzer** identifies and highlights the protocols that have strong fundamentals, sustainable revenue models, and the potential for long-term success in the Real Yield DeFi space. This comprehensive tool not only provides valuable insights but also facilitates research, analysis, discernment, and decision-making for investors regarding the best market opportunities. With the Analyzer, investors can navigate the complex DeFi landscape with ease, confidently identifying the protocols that align with their investment goals and maximizing their chances of success.
