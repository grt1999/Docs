# ðŸ›  Getting started

7VFI.AI has multiple product concepts that could be further explored and improved utilizing our robust data infrastructure. These suggestions are based on our in-depth research into market bottlenecks, inefficient dynamics, and areas lacking user engagement that could be explored and improved.

**Under Current Development - Target Release Date: Jan/2024**

* Rank Select: an advanced tool designed for Web3, utilizing a sophisticated, multi-layered data-approach to thoroughly assess and pinpoint promising opportunities across various crypto niches and ecosystems. This module provides a Protocol Analyzer Ranking Scorecard for Real Yield DeFi opportunities, and our vision extends to developing scorecards for RWA protocols, yield opportunities on centralized exchanges, NFT ecosystems, and GameFi & Metaverses.

**Next suggested products for development with third-party Developers, Partners and Grant Donors:**

* AI Liquidity Master: an automated concentrated liquidity provision system. The protocol would strategically allocate funds across top liquidity pools from various exchanges, monitor real-time data and assess metrics for optimal returns, impermanent loss calculations, risk analysis, and fee optimization. This would streamline and enhance concentrated liquidity provision in DeFi. An AI-powered bot driven by AI tools that will automate the liquidity provision process. This bot would not only monitor the user's position 24/7 but also rebalance it if it goes out of the range. The system would select optimal ranges based on historical data and AI deep learning/machine learning algorithms. The user would be able to define their risk profile among three options (risk-neutral, risk-averse, or risk-pro). Through account abstraction, the software will deploy capital in top liquidity pools on major DEXes, with a consistent focus on blue-chip tokens and stablecoins.
* Venue Flow: automated system to select the best venues for liquid staking tokens across various DeFi protocols, allowing users to adopt a "set it and forget it" approach, leveraging their liquid staking expertise and yield enhancement potential with their liquid staking derivative tokens. The integration automates the delegation of funds to validators or staking pools in liquid staking protocols via account abstraction. An AI-driven software would analyze crucial data points, optimize rewards, and minimize risks through intelligent tracking and management of user staking positions. Seamlessly connection with major protocols to enhance the staking and redemption experiences. An AI-powered tool will orchestrate the entire staking, redemption, interaction, and utilization process of LSDs across compatible protocols to yield additional gains. This process is facilitated by account abstraction, with users configuring their preferences based on their risk profile (risk-neutral, risk-averse, or risk-pro).
