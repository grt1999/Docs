# 7VFI.AI - Money-Legos Module: Yield Supercharger

The concept of "money-legos" in DeFi refers to the ability to combine different protocols to create complex financial structures. Just like building with interlocking building blocks, where each block represents a specific DeFi protocol or application. By combining these "money-legos," users can create innovative strategies for improving the generating of continuous yield strategies in the DeFi ecosystem. However, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration of the risks involved. Users face risks when selecting subpar protocols or mistiming capital delegation on farming and staking opportunities. Our goal is to streamline this journey, enabling "yield hopping" by leveraging the compound interest effect. Users will be able to achieve this by recycling fees from core positions to "satellite positions" in niche market segments. These niche market segments host protocols that serve as yield aggregators and yield optimizers, be they established or emerging. 7VFI.AIâ€™s approach also involves making the most of sustainable capital sources across various categories while embracing the potential of liquid staking derivative tokens, in order to increase the chances of generating additional yields.

7VFI.AI Yield Supercharger A.I. powered tool is focused on continuous yield generation involves identifying and capitalizing on opportunities across various projects and protocols in the DeFi space. By leveraging the compound interest effect and employing a dynamic money legos approach, the A.I. software is able to attain unwavering outcomes allowing users to maximize the potential for growth and create cycles of efficiency.

In summary, the 7VFI.AI Yield Supercharger approach to continuous yield generation is built upon a foundation of concentrated liquidity provision. Through daily monitoring and rebalancing, the software aims to achieve optimal yields within narrow ranges across blue-chip token pools. A significant portion of the fees collected from these activities will be strategically allocated to satellite positions, earning additional yield in selected protocols based on the 7VFI.AI proprietary scorecard. This includes both emerging and established projects, ensuring a diversified approach.
